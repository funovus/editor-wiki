# [](dcei.engine.proto.Effect.remove)**[Data](Data)\\[Effect](Data-Effect)\Remove** {dataEffectRemove}
Removes a unit from the game.

Note that this will immediately remove and destroy the unit's actor, unless the actor has the [Preserve On Unit Remove](Data-Actor-Unit-Actor#preserve-on-unit-remove) flag enabled. Removing a unit does not trigger on-death effects (such as triggers, damage response behaviors, or deatg response behaviors.)
