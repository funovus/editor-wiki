# [Data](Data)\\[Actor](Data-Actor)\\Event Macro

Event Macros are simply a set of [Actor Events](Data-ActorEvent) that can be added to other actors through their [Event Macros](Data-Actor-Unit-Actor#event-macros) field.

This is incredibly useful for eliminating repetitive actor events and sharing common actor data across multiple units or actors (such as shared global response to status effects). This helps with project organization and maintenance and can save much time and effort when making and adjusting the events of many actors at once.
