[](dcei.engine.proto.ThrowMover)**MessageType: [ThrowMover](GenericMessage#throwmover)**

Moves the missile unit in a fixed direction. Unlike other movers, this mover doesn't move towards the target and will move indefinitely unless some other means of hit detection are used (such as the arrive_on_search_hit flag), or replaced by another mover (either by another launch missile effect, or when used in a multi-stage mover).
